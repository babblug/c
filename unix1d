Study of linux/unix file system(tree structure)
DESCRIPTION: 
A file system is a logical extension of files on a position disc.UNIX uses a 
hierarchial file system structure, much like an upside-down tree, with soot(/) at the 
base of file system is a collection of files and directories that has the following 
properties.131
-> It has a root directory(/) that contains other files and directories.
-> Each file or directory is uniquely identified by its name the directory in which it 
resides and a unique identifier, typically caused an inode.
->By convention, the root directory has an inodenumber of three. Inode numbers 0 
and 1 are not used. File inode numbers can be seen specifying the -i option to ls 
command.
->It is self contained. There are no dependencies between one file system and the 
other.
The directories have a specific purpose and generally hold the same types of 
information for easily locating files. Following are the directories that exist on 
major versions of unix.
DIRECTORY DESCRIPTION:
/ ->This is root directory which should contain only the directories needed at the 
top level of file structure.
/bin ->This is tthe ls where the executable files are located. They are available to 
all the users.
/dev ->These are device drivers.
/etc ->supervisor directory commands, configuration files, disk configuration files, 
valid user lists, groups, ethernet, hosts where to send critical messages.
/fib ->constraints shared library files and sometimes ther kernal selected files
/boot ->contains files for booting the system
/home ->contains the home directory for users and other acccounts.
/mnt ->used to mount other temporary file system such as cdrom and floppy for the 
CDROM drive and floppy diskette drives respectively.
/psoc ->contains oil process marked as a file by process number on their 
information that is dynamically to the system.
/tmp ->holds temporary files used between system boots.132
/usr ->used for miscellaneous purposes or can be used by many users includes 
administrative commands, shared files, library files and others.
/var ->Typically contains variable length files such as log and print files and any 
other type of file that may contain variable amount of data.
/sbin -> contains binary(executable ) files, usually for system administration. For 
example fidrsk and IFCONFIG utilities.
/kernal ->contains kernal files.
